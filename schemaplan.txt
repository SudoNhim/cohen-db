--[chapter]

Each document comprises of the following parts, all optional:
filename/          // directory containing any child files
filename.json      // metadata about the doc
filename.about.md  // the about content, e.g. "This document comes from..."
filename.text.md   // the document content

The text content in this file is a sort of custom markdown that supports:
- **bold** and _italics_
- [links like this](http://website.com)
- [internal links](#album.popular_problems)

And a special tag syntax for tagging parts as relevant to another document
- <#23 to=album.popular_problems>something about popular problems</#23>

An extension of this allows for referencing a specific tag in the target document
- <#23 to=album.popular_problems#11>something about popular problems</#23>

For the latter case, tag #11 is expected to be a symmetric reference pointing back the other way (for now), and this will be verified by the integrity check.
