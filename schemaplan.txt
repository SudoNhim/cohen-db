## Each document comprises of the following parts, all optional:
filename/                // directory containing any child files
filename.meta.json       // metadata about the document
filename.content.xml     // the document content

## filename.meta.json
Simple set of properties, e.g.
{
    title: "You Want it Darker",
    date: "2016-10-14"
}

## filename.content.xml
Content can be in the outer scope by default, but subparts that have special significance can be wrapped in a few components like <prologue>

The text content in the XML file is a sort of custom markdown that supports:
- **bold** and _italics_
- [links like this](http://website.com)
- [internal links](#album.popular_problems)

A special tag indicates that content is not part of the source material, and so should not be indexed in search:
- <meta>Sung with the following additional verse:</meta>

And a special tag syntax for tagging parts as relevant to another document
- <#23 to=album.popular_problems>something about popular problems</#23>

An extension of this allows for referencing a specific tag in the target document
- <#23 to=album.popular_problems#11>something about popular problems</#23>

TODO: rethink this a bit.
Perhaps any doc to be referenced must have its textparts/paragraphs/lines annotated with IDs, and the referencer also saved the start of the expected string for integrity check
