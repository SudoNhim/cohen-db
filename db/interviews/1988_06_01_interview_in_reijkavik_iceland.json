I didn't sleep with her, in that sense I touched her perfect body with my mind. The landscape was the Montreal Harbour. There is a church there that has a Virgin overlooking the Harbour, \"Our Lady of the Harbour\", \"Notre-Dame de Bon Secours\", it's her name, but the whole landscape is the Montreal waterfront. So in a sense it's just reportage, just as accurate as I could make it and the boats go by, and she invited me down to the river. She was a little flipped out. She did serve me tea and oranges. And that's exactly as it happened."
