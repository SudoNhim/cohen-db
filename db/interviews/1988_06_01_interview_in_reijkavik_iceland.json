            "Yeah another song came on top of that. So I'd already recorded that one. And I wanted to push the Hallelujah deep into the secular world, into the ordinary world. The Hallelujah, the David's Hallelujah was still a religious song. So I wanted to indicate that Hallelujah can come out of things that have nothing to do with religion."

            "There was a girl named Suzanne, who invited me down to her place near the river and she did serve me a kind of tea that had oranges in it and...... I didn't sleep with her, in that sense I touched her perfect body with my mind. The landscape was the Montreal Harbour. There is a church there that has a Virgin overlooking the Harbour, \"Our Lady of the Harbour\", \"Notre-Dame de Bon Secours\", it's her name, but the whole landscape is the Montreal waterfront. So in a sense it's just reportage, just as accurate as I could make it� and the boats go by, and she invited me down to the river. She was a little flipped out. She did serve me tea and oranges. And that's exactly as it happened."
