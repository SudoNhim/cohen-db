            "Hallelujah is a Hebrew word which means \"Glory to the Lord.\" The song explains that many kinds of Hallelujahs do exist . I say : \"All the perfect and broken Hallelujahs have an equal value .\" It's, as I say, a desire to affirm my faith in life,not in some formal religious way but with enthusiasm, with emotion."
