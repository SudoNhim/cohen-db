            "\"Suzanne\" is very hard to sing. I can't seem to find the place to sing it from, though the song does have the Montreal landscape in it: the church by the harbor, the place we used to live by the river, and my mother's house that I still go back to. The woman there and that experience were very much a part of the emotional landscape of Montreal."
