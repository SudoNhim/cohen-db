Although, it became the song and people don't do the patter anymore, don't do that kind of set-up for it. But, there is one, it's very charming. I have a couple of improvised lines in there. I wouldn't have kept the track if it didn't have such exuberance. A number of the musicians told me it was among the happiest sessions they'd ever played. It was a good party."
