Some are surprising me, songs I really thought I could sing, like \"Bird On a Wire.\" I'm not sure it's necessary to say, \"I swear by this song and by all I've done wrong that I will make it all up to thee.\" Either I've done that, or there's no point in making that promise again if I haven't. It's very hard to get behind certain lines"
