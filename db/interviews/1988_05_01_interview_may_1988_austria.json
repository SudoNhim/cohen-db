            "Suzanne was a composite of a number of women that I know but the actual Suzanne did take me down to her place near the river and did serve me a kind of tea called 'Constant Comment' that had oranges, a little piece of orange skin, in it. So a lot of it was reportage, and that young woman is still alive, yes of course. She has kind of pissed off at me because she felt I should have cut her in on the profits. Interviewer: Oh she wanted to share in your royalties? Yes, more or less, but the song was stolen from me anyway. I lost the rights of the song myself."
