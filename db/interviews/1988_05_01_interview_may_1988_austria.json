So a lot of it was reportage, and that young woman is still alive, yes of course. She has kind of pissed off at me because she felt I should have cut her in on the profits. Interviewer: Oh she wanted to share in your royalties? Yes, more or less, but the song was stolen from me anyway. I lost the rights of the song myself."
