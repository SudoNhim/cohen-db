            "The song doesn't end with a plea for peace. It doesn't end with a plea for sanity between the generations. It ends saying, \"I'll kill you if I can, I will help you if I must, I will kill you if I must, I will help you if I can.\" That's all I can say about it. My father died when I was nine, that's the reason I put that one of us had to go."
