The voice has completely changed, the tempo changed a lot, the experience of the singer also, it's more evident today.. It seems to me that between the original version and this one, there is all the real-life of a man passing through. Of a man who's not the same anymore. And this is a thing I appreciate very much, to be able to measure these changes. The original version of \"Suzanne\" is full of hope, compassion and idealism. This last one offers a crack, a bruise. It's the end of the story somehow... My wanting to sing this song today is maybe reckless, but I intended to show this crack, this ending of the story."
