            "About the fact of including \"Suzanne\" in the new Live album of 1994.",
            "For me \"Suzanne\" is the best song from this record. Precisely because you can compare yesterday with today, compare different versions. The voice has completely changed, the tempo changed a lot, the experience of the singer also, it's more evident today.. It seems to me that between the original version and this one, there is all the real-life of a man passing through. Of a man who's not the same anymore. And this is a thing I appreciate very much, to be able to measure these changes. The original version of \"Suzanne\" is full of hope, compassion and idealism. This last one offers a crack, a bruise. It's the end of the story somehow... My wanting to sing this song today is maybe reckless, but I intended to show this crack, this ending of the story."
