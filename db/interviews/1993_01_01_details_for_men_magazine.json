              "That was written with Janis Joplin in mind. A couple of years after she died I was in a Polynesian restaurant in Miami and the thought of her was very strong. I started writing that lyric and finished it in a town in the north of Ethiopia. I went there after the Yom Kippur War for some odd reason, and I ended up in the Imperial Hotel finishing that song, getting the last chorus: \"I need you, I don't need you, and all that jiving around.\""

              "That was written on Clinton Street. I never felt I really sealed that song; I never felt the carpentry was finished. That song and \"Bird on the Wire\" were two songs I never successfully finished, but they were good enough to be used. Also, with the poverty of songs I have for each record, I can't afford to discard one as good as that. It's one of the better tunes I've written, but lyrically it's too mysterious, too unclear."
