            "My personal \"mythology\" for bravery and courage is filled with the Spanish Civil War, the French Resistance.... and the concentration camps. They might be forgotten by the younger generation but I think the emotions are still valid, and I wanted to again introduce into the air the energy and the emotions these experiences left. I believe it's useful."
