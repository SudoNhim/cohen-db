            "I always begin my concert with this song. It seems to return me to my duties. It was begun in Greece and finished in a motel in Hollywood    around 1969 along with everything else.  Some lines were changed in Oregon.  I can't seem to get it perfect.  Kris Kristofferson informed me   that I had stolen part of the melody from another Nashville writer. He also said that he's putting the first couple of lines on his tombstone, and I'll be hurt if he doesn't."

I began it at a bar in a polynesian restaurant in Miami Beach in 1971 and finished it in Asmara, Ethiopia just before the throne was overturned. Ron Cornelius helped me with a chord change in an earlier version."

It hung more heroically when I took out the lining, and achieved glory when the frayed sleeves were repaired with a little leather. Things were clear. I knew how to dress in those days. It was stolen from Marianne's loft in NY sometime suring the early seventies. I wasn't wearing it very much toward the end."

The song is half-written in pencil but it protects us as we manoeuvre, each of us, for unconditional victory.",

The song had too many verses and it took about five years to sort out the right ones. I like the children* in this version. I always wait for them if I have to listen to it.",

Her hospitality was immaculate. Some months later I sang it to Judy Collins over the telephone. The publishing rights were pilfered in NYC but it is probably appropriate that I don't own this song. Just the other day I heard some people singing it on a ship in the Caspian sea."
