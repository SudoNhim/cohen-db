This fits with the pacifist currents of the 70s in the US, but its probable that the correct interpretation is much darker. Aligning with the fifth verse, the spirit of this song is to succeed \"against the enemy\". The rather than a choice then, these two lines become the most important things you can do with your god-given body; to fight, and to reproduce. This makes a lot more sense under the circumstances in which the song was written."
