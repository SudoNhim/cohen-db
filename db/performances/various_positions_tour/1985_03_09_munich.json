            "It was a long time ago in New York City. There was a very great singer who stayed at the same hotel that I stayed at. And I used to meet her in the elevator late at night. She wasn't looking for me. She was looking for Kris Kristofferson. And to be indiscreet, I wasn't looking for her, I was looking for Brigitte Bardot. But through a curious twist of fate, we found ourselves on the same elevator. A particularly dismal, brown elevator, full of aimless ups and downs, and reeking with despair. This elevator never took anyone where they wanted to go. They only took us back to our rooms. Anyhow the hotel was the Chelsea Hotel and the singer was Janis Joplin, whose voice will never die."
