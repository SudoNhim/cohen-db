              "It was very nice of the Russians to build this Hall for me. My mother came from Russia, she spoke very highly of those people. It is a beautiful Hall, and I thank the Authorities for allowing me to play here. I wish we had a Hall like this where I come from. I would throw a huge party here, I would invite everyone. Maybe I'd just live here alone by myself. I need a lot of space."
