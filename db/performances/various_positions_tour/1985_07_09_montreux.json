After a while I gathered my courage and I said to her, \"Are you looking for something?\" And she said, \"Yes, I'm looking for something.\" I knew by the tone of her voice that she wasn't trying to realize some unfulfilled potential of her inner nature, that she was actually looking for something. I said, \"Who or what are you looking for?\" She said, \"Kris Kristofferson.\" I said,     \"I am Kris Kristofferson.\" And I deceived her for many nights. A long time after that, I found myself at a bar in a Polynesian restaurant in Miami Beach, leaning over a napkin and one of those drinks that they serve in a porcelain coconut shell. I was writing a song to this very lady. I was the very image of myself, 40 years old, thin, neglected with a great song on my mind. It took me a while to finish it. It's for Janis Joplin at the Chelsea Hotel."
