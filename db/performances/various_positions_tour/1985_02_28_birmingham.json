It's a story about a young woman that I met in an elevator in a hotel in New York City. One of the greatest singers that I ever heard. I was wandering around all night.that was a great elevator, you know. It was only about 4 feet wide. It was the very hub of my social activity. I didn't get around very much but sometimes I'd meet somebody in that elevator. Around three in the morning, I used to see this other dismal person in this elevator. And I looked into her eyes. She avoided my eyes and it became clear to me that she wasn't looking for me. She was looking for Kris Kristofferson. I said, \"I am Kris Kristofferson.\" She said, \"I thought you were a lot taller.\" I said, \"I am a lot taller but it's just photography.\" And the truth be told, I wasn't looking for her; she was a kind of sad-looking girl with knotty, curling hair and a very bad complexion. I wasn't looking for her. I said, \"Well, the truth be told, I'm looking for the granddaughter of Mae West,\" who doesn't even exist. And one thing lead to another. Well, we found ourselves together. And it was a long time later after she died that I wrote this song for her. Her name was Janis Joplin. It was at the Chelsea Hotel."
