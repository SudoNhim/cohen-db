            "I wrote this song a long time ago, under the most prosaic circumstances.   I noticed outside of my window that there was a wire directed by the telephone company. On that wire, there was a bird... (singing).....Like a bird\"....... (applause) .... (stops playing). I really enjoy your recognizing  the song but I'm scared enough as it is up here. I think something's wrong every time you begin to applaude. So, if you do recognize the song, will you just wave your hand? I would really like to see you all wave your hands if you recognize the song. I hope you bear with me. These songs are kind of,  they become meditations for me and sometimes I just don't get high on it and I feel that I'm cheating you. So I'll try it again, okay? And if it doesn't work, I'll stop in the middle. There is no reason why we should mutilate a song just to save face. But here it goes..."
