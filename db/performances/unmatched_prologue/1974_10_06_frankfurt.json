            "It was the end of the 60's, the beginning of the 70's. We saw the battalion of a kind of apocalyptic vision about what the world was going be and what rock music or pop music was going to be in it. And toward the end of that time we saw the casualties, the burnt out acid heads, the dead singers, famous and obscure. This is a song that I wrote to one of those great singers that I knew. It comes out of a time when a lot musicians used to staying at the Chelsea Hotel in New York City."
