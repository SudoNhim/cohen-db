I used to bump into her in the elevator about three in the morning, completely by mistake. She wasn't looking for me. I think she was looking for Kris Kristofferson. And I wasn't looking for her. I was looking for...Brigitte Bardot. Anyhow, we fell into each other's arms through some process of elimination, which is the process by which most things happen and I loved...There's music going on here that is not my own. How delightful. How delightful to hear music that is not my own. Bring it up...Last time I saw her was on 23d Street. She said, \"Hey man, you in town to read poetry for old ladies?\" That was her view of my career. Anyhow, there was no sense of ambiguity or division in her relation with her audience, with her public, and after she split, after she died, I wrote this song for her, Janis Joplin."

Perhaps some of you know it. Perhaps some of you were living with me then. I'm glad I don't remember you. It was a terrible hotel room. The windows wouldn't close. The radiator wouldn't stop hissing. The faucet wouldn't stop its mythological drip into the destroying porcelain sink. I was with the wrong woman as usual. But as your Eastern physicians, Eastern metaphysicians know, just as from the darkest mud blooms the whitest lotus, so from the brownest hotel room you occasionally get a good song."
