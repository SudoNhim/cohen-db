I feel many kinds of tyranies that almost everytime men brute themselves together. I flash their tyranies.. but this is not the government or anything, this is the tyranny that I feel myself which is the possession of women and women's possession of men.

I  know it's not mean but.. .Today with those headlines I really felt that somehow a war was begun. And it's against that kind of people that I'm gonna sing this next song. Few years ago I was in Edmonton, Alberta, a Northern Canadian city. There I first begun to encounter a different look in people's eye something much more profund than a difference of dress, but a different kind of expression and a different kind of greeting. And I met in a Cafe two young girls, and we spent the day together, they showed me through the snowstorm in Edmonton - they have 6 months of winter - and  we slept together in the evening the three of us. And during the night, although the sleep was gentle, I woke up and I wrote this song very very quickly and I actually had it ready for them once they woke up and as soon as they woke up -These are one of the few bonuses of being a poet, believe me.. .When they woke up I was ready with this song, I'll do anything you know."
