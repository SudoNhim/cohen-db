            "Thank you for your silence. You might have asked me for a song I have not rehearsed. When the Prince of Peace was hanging from the branch in His final tree, and He looked down at the Romans and the Jews, and He saw the faces of bewilderment and envy and greed and despair and melancholy, a lever was thrown in the cosmos. And He looked down at these anxious faces and He knew, He knew for certain, He knew at last, He knew with a finality that He had never known before, there ain't no cure for love."

They were the reddest roses with the largest thorns that I ever did see. And you were so kind as to sign your name in such a manner that I could not read it. I deeply appreciate your sense of modesty. I thank you for the items that you sent me, the monkey and the plywood violin, and I practiced every night and now I'm ready. First we take Manhattan, then we take Berlin."

It was the \"Poems of Federico Garcia Lorca\". And I accepted his invitation to enter that world of crystals and ants and thighs and arches. And when I got old enough to realize that I owed someone my gratitude, I wrote him this tiny homage based on a great poem he wrote called \"Little Viennese Waltz.\""
