            "My daughter dyed her hair blue and I didn't mind,and she put this ring in her nose : I didn't mind that either.And she put this stud through her tongue.That was a little hard for a father to take but I didn't really feel like doing violence to her relationship just because you put a nail through a tongue. There are things you have to accept.Then she said she want to move to  Amsterdam. That's when I put my foot down.( all this is my way of introducing a song ).My daughter was named after a great poet that touched me very much when I was her age.His name is Federico Garcia Lorca.My daughter's name is Lorca.And this is the song for him."
