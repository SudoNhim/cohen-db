There are things you have to accept.Then she said she want to move to  Amsterdam. That's when I put my foot down.( all this is my way of introducing a song ).My daughter was named after a great poet that touched me very much when I was her age.His name is Federico Garcia Lorca.My daughter's name is Lorca.And this is the song for him."
