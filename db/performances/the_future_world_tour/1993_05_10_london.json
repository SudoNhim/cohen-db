I really appreciate it, really appreciate it. It doesn't help at all. Some of you have written me over the years. You've sent me letters and flowers and I really appreciate it. But it just doesn't help at all. One damn thing leads to another just makes you feel worse and worse...I'm so happy to see every 5 or 6 years..Hope this can go on for another decade or two. I'm here to sing to your children and your grand-children. Let's not be selfish. Let's leave this distant rule to them. Maybe they can figure out how to work it out. Let's not pretend that we know anything about anything. This is a mess. Let's join hands and be in this mess together. Let's not pretend one of us has a solution that the other hasn't figured out. We're in this boat together It always amuses me to know we're in this catastrophy, the flood is calm, the landmarks are overturned, the lights are extinguished, each man holding to his piece of orange crate, broken flag staff, and we still hear \"I'm for abortion\", \"I'm against abortion\" \"I'm for the left\", \"I'm for the right\". In the midst of this urgency, how dare we speak. Our needs are so manifold we dare not declare them. And I lift my glass to the Awful Truth - Which you can't reveal to the Ears of Youth - Except to say it isn't worth a dime - And the whole damn place goes crazy twice - And it's once for the devil and it's once for Christ - But the Boss don't like these dizzy heights - We're busted in the blinding lights - Of Closing Time......"

I was really pleased when she put a ring in her nose. I was delighted at the age of 18 when she dyed her hair blue. Later on it was.... you can understand a father's pride....when she put a stud through her tongue.....(laughs)...She lives within the true spirit of the poet. and I love her for it. It was with a great sense of anxiety and trepidation that I began to translate one of the great poems of Federico Garcia Lorca and it has been a great source of pleasure to me to receive a letter from his sister congratulating me on my tiny hommage to this great poet's work.
