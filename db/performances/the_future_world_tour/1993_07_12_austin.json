In those days there were slogans you know \"Democracy is coming to the East, is coming to the Soviet Union, is coming to Hungary, Poland\". And I thought to myself \"that doesn't seem right, something doesn't ring true in this rejoicing\", and among the many many verses that I wrote in the song you're about to hear, I asked myself that question: \"Where is democracy coming ?\" and country after country dissolved as an answer and there really only was one answer, that was \"Democracy is coming to the USA\"."

And it has become a kind of \"black hole\" in the national Cosmos into which you know all the noblest and fiercest aspirations of a generation sunk and disappeared in a kind of Bermuda Triangle of Idealism. And this is the song that I wrote many many years ago when I refuse that seductive invitation to join in a general celebration of another silly idea."
