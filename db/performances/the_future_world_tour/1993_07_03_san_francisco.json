My mother said to me, even though I was a grown man, \"Watch out for those people Leonard, they aren't like we are.\" I was deeply offended by her presumption of giving a man of such (?) this advice but after I'd lost the copyright to \"Suzanne\" and \"The Stranger Song\" and \"Dress Rehearsal Rag,\" I think I knew what she was talking about. There was however some compensations, some consolations, a sophisticated hotel on 23rd Street. You can enter with a pigmy and a polar bear and not an eyebrow was raised, the key was just shoved across the counter.  I used to ride the elevator late at night, up and down.I noticed that there was a young woman in that elevator.  I did not know the great fame, the renowned she had attained. All I knew was that she was a nightrider like myself, trying to pass the hours of the early morning. I gathered my courage and I summoned the most razor-like approach that I could carve for her presence and I said, \"Are you looking for someone?\" She said, \"Yes I'm looking for Kris Kristofferson.\" I said, \"Lucky lady, you're in luck tonight. I'm Kris Kristofferson.\" Well, such was the generosity of those times that she never called me on it.  A couple of years later after she passed over to the other side, I found myself at this bar in a Polynesian restaurant in Miami Beach. Life leads the thoughtful man on a path of many windings. I was drinking a cocktail out of a ceramic coconut.  This was an imponderable mystery because the entire place was frothing with actual, authentic coconuts. I hold these mysteries on the level of the trinity. Not only can they not be"

I really don't know what they stand for at all but I'm deeply grateful that my dressing room is heaped with this kind of debris from many other positions of course, but my own.

I opened it and I accepted the poet's invitation to enter into this world where fistfuls of ants were thrown at the sun and crystals obscured the pine trees and there were the arches of Elvira to pass through and begin weeping and there were those thighs that slipped away like schools of silver minnows. That was the irresistible seductive invitation I could not resist. I slipped into that fist, I did, I lived among the ants and I learned their ways. I mastered the crystals. I healed many alcoholic gurus with my crystal powers. I passed through the arches of Elvira and I did, I began weeping. That's nothing new. I saw those thighs glistening like hunting horns and I touched them, I did, I pulled my hand away and I slipped away like a school of silver minnows. I've never left that world. I stand here tonight and I invite you all to join me here. There's lots of space, there's no boundaries, there's no politics, no language. All you have to do is celebrate the sunlight coming through the hair of your beloved. It's a simple thing. And it's my great honour and my great privilege and my tiny duty to render this homage to the great Spanish poet who invited me there, Federico Garcia Lorca.Take this waltz, take this waltz."
