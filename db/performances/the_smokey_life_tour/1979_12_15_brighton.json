I wrote it on the road, it's kind of irreverent, but you're not very religious in this part of the country anyway, so I doubt if it would offend anybody. Anyway, this is the \"Blues by the Jews\", here it is..."

I used to walk on those dusty roads singing Greensleeves. I haven't sung that for a long time. Please also don't ask me for \"Don't pass me by\" because I only ever did that once."
