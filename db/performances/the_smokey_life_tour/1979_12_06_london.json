At the time LC sung this live the song was having a resurgence in popularity, and was a popular symbol in the civil rights battle. The authenticity of the song is on rather shaky ground - Billie grew up in New York, and the song was written by a Jewish communist living in The Bronx, based on a photo he saw that was itself a civil rights symbol.",
