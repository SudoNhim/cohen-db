I used to bump into her from time to time, at a Hotel in NY where a lot of musicians used to come. Lot of those musicians are now gone. They say the era is over. They say these are now the times of the conservative, the stable, the order. Well, perhaps that's true. She certainly stood for something that was beyond order and beyond chaos, beyond the radical and beyond the conservative. Which is what every (you know) great singer embodies, something that is not an argument and not a philosophy. Anyhow I wrote this song for her, long time ago. It's dedicated to Janis Joplin. It's called \"Chelsea Hotel\"."

In a room named for your most forceful composer, Beethoven, it seems difficult for this stranger to be at the very center of all this power,and I want to thank you for welcoming me in this mystical center of fire and ice."
