            "During the war of 1973, Cohen unofficially joined the Israeli Army and appeared with some of Israel's best singers before the soldiers at the front. One of the young Israeli singers who accompanied Cohen was Matti Caspi. Caspi has since been recognized as one of Israel's most gifted musicians. In a recent interview, Caspi tells more: during the 1973 war, Matti Caspi, Ilana Rovina, Oshik Levi and Pupik Arnon were a team called \"the Jeneva conference\". Leonard Cohen came to Israel for a period of two months especially for that and he joined them as a singer, with Matti Caspi as the guitarist. Caspi tells that Cohen used to improvise on stage, and during their second performance together he wrote \"Lover come back to me\" (i.e. \"Lover, Lover, Lover\") right there on stage in front of the soldiers.�",

Unfortunately, for my last song, I must offend your deepest sensibilities with an entirely irrelevant and vulgar ditty that I wrote some time ago with another Jew in Hollywood, where there are many. This is a song in which    I have placed my most irrelevant and banal adolescent recollections.I humbly ask you for your indulgence. As I look back to the red acne of my adolescence, to the unmanageable desire of my early teens, to that time when every woman shone like the eternal light above the altar place and   I myself, was always on my knees before some altar, unimaginably more quiescent, potent, powerful and relevant than anything I could ever command. I speak of nothing less than womanhood, that elusive butterfly...."
