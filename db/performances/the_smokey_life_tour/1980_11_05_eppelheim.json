Feels quite glamorous when I look back on it......during the time I was ewtremely busy. You know I would go from the automat to the Bronco Burger, from the Bronco Burger to the automat, back to the Hotel, over to the Bronco Burger, over to the automat....it was not an exalted existence. A total dismal drag except for one evening which was illuminated by a particular moment. It was the elevator and riding the elevator through some divine, cosmic, benign mercy, there was a very beautiful young woman in the elevator, the same time as I was. It turned out she was a very great American singer, I didn't know at the time. She wasn't looking for me, and I wasn't looking for her. She was looking for Kris Kristofferson. And I was looking for....Oh I never knew whom I was looking for...Anyhow, through some divine........anyhow, it turned that this young woman was Janis Joplin. I wrote this song for her."
