And he said \"consummatum est - it is finished.\" And he looked beneath him, at the Romans and the Jews and all the mankind looking up at him with the various positions of indifference, guilt, remorse, ecstasy, indifference. And he understood then, finally, what it was to be a human. He understood there ain't no cure for love..."

            "Years ago, I used to live in a hotel in New York City. It was a very good hotel. And even though it seemed very shabby it was quite sophisticated. In fact at 3 in the morning you could go up to the desk accompanied by a brachycephalic teenager and a polar bear and ask for your key, and they'd give it to you without raising an eyebrow. It was in this hotel's elevator that I noticed a young woman huddling in the corner. And after 3 or 4 nights I gathered my courage and I asked her if she was looking for someone. She said, \"Yes, I'm looking for Kris Kristofferson\" I said, \"My dear Lady you're in luck, I'm Kris Kristofferson\" I knew she didn't believe me, but we spent some time together there and a couple of years after she died I was thinking about her, thinking about those nights in that hotel. I was sitting at a bar in Miami Beach, a particularly poisonous Polynesian restaurant where they serve you drinks in ceramic coconut shells. It's a place to be avoided. I hope I never meet any of you there. And I was thinking of this young woman who was a very great singer and I began this song for her. It was Janis Joplin at the Chelsea Hotel..."

So it's clear that there's no point in escalating this battle to any further pitch of panic. We're all in the same leaking boat together, and we all pay for our lives in the highest coin. Therefore my position today to the one I love is merely to say, \"I'm your man\"."

            "It was about 300 years ago today that I stumbled on a book by a Spanish poet. A book that was to alter my life completely. You see I was destined to be a brain surgeon or a forest ranger or even just to go into the family clothing business. But in this old bookstore I opened a book and I read the lines \"I want to pass through the arches of Elvira, to see your thighs and begin weeping.\" I turned to the cover of the book, it was written by a Spanish poet by the name of Frederico Garcia Lorca, and for the first time I understood that there was another world and I wanted to be in it. So it was a great honour for me when I was asked to translate one of his great poems into English and to set it to music. The poem is Little Viennese Waltz which I called Take This Waltz."

You see I was destined to be a brain surgeon or a forest ranger or even just to go into the family clothing business. But in this old bookstore I opened a book and I read the lines \"I want to pass through the arches of Elvira, to see your thighs and begin weeping.\" I turned to the cover of the book, it was written by a Spanish poet by the name of Frederico Garcia Lorca, and for the first time I understood that there was another world and I wanted to be in it. So it was a great honour for me when I was asked to translate one of his great poems into English and to set it to music. The poem is Little Viennese Waltz which I called Take This Waltz."
