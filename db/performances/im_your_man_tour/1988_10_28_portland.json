            "A long time ago, I left my hometown of Montreal and I went down to NY to try to break into that infernal enterprise called show-business. I stayed in a very agreeable Hotel there, a very sophisticated place. You could go up at two in the morning to the frontdesk accompanied by a pygmy and a polar bear, ask for your key and without a raised eyebrow, they just hand it to you and say \"Have a nice night Mr Cohen\". It was in the elevator of this Hotel that I began to notice night after night a young woman who happened to be riding that diabolical vehicle just the same time as I. Afterwhile I gathered my courage and I said to her : \"Are you looking for someone ?\" She said \"Yes, I'm looking for Kris Kristofferson\". I said \"Little Lady, you're in luck, I am kris Kristofferson\". Such was the generosity of those times that she didn't lead on, not even once. It was some time after she passed from this vale of tears that I found myself at a bar, in a Polynesian restaurant, in Miami beach, drinking an alcoholic beverage from a ceramic coconut shell. This was a mystery I could not penetrate. Because there was real coconut shells on every tree on the boulevard. The song came. It's for Janis Joplin at the Chelsea Hotel."

            "There are many candidates promoting themselves today. I would like to get in mind to promote myself for something rather, I don't know what it is. I think there's some�office out there, challenging me, challenging my best efforts. I think I can do something for somebody, I can't quite figure out what it is but I want you all to know that I do my best I don't know exactly what exactly that entails and exactly how far to go with it. I don't want anybody to kill anybody when I've got my back turned. I think what I'm really trying to get is a woman's caress and I don't want anybody else to feel�that I'm trying to eat them out of this high office, and there's plenty to go round�but I want to state unconditionally right now that I'm your man."
