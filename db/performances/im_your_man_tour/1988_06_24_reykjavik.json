It wasn't a bad Hotel, it wasn't a good Hotel but in the elevator there I begin to bump into  a young woman late at night. After a couple of weeks i gathered my courage and I said to her \"Are you looking for someone?\" She said \"Yes, I'm looking for Kris Kristofferson\" I said \"Lucky Lady, You're in luck, I am Kris Kristofferson\". Such was the generosity of those times. A couple of years later, after this young woman had passed from this vale of tears, I found myself sitting at a Bar in a Polynesian restaurant in Miami Beach. It was a Bar where they served cocktails in ceramic coconut shells.This was a mystery I could not penetrate, because the very trees in Boulevards were lined with coconut trees, bearing true and authentic coconut shells. Why they would choose to serve their drinks in ceramic coconut shells escapes me until this very day.As I say I was sitting at the Bar of this Polynesian restaurant when the presence of this young woman came upon me very strongly. And upon a napkin I began that song, for Janis Joplin at the Chelsea Hotel."

I was 15 years old and I was wandering through the bookstores of Montreal and I fell upon one of his books,and I opened it,and my eyes saw those lines \"I want to pass through the Arches of Elvira,to see her thighs and begin weeping\". I thought \"This is where I want to be\"... I read alone \"Green I want you green \"I turned another page \"The morning through fistfulls of ants in your face\" I turned another page \"Her thighs slipped away like school of silver minnows\". I knew that I have had come home. So it is with a great sense of gratitude that I am able to repay my debt to Federico Garcia, at least a corner, a fragment, a crumb, a hair, an electron of my debt by dedicating this song, this translation of his great poem \"Little Viennese Waltz\", \"Take This Waltz\"."
