            "Last year it was the 50th anniversary of the death of Federico Garcia Lorca, a great Spanish writer. He was the first poet that ever touched me. And i remember the first lines of his that i ever read that moved me into this delicious racket called poetry. It was: \"I want to pass through the arches of Elvira*, to see your thighs and begin weeping\". That line burned itself into my heart and i've written it over and over again in a hundred songs. This is a song of his,called \"Little Viennese Waltz\" that i had the great honor to translate and set to music.",
