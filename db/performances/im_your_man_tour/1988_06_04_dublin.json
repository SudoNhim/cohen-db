              "A thousand years ago I used to live at this Hotel...( Applause )... I thought I saw you there. Every evening about three in the morning I'd bump into this young woman in the elevator, and after a couple of weeks I gathered up my courage and I asked her, \"Are you looking for someone?\" And she said, \"Yes I'm looking for Kris Kristofferson\". I said, \"Lucky Lady, you're in luck, I am Kris Kristofferson.\" Such was the generosity of the age that she never let on. Anyhow it was a couple of years later, after she passed away, that I was sitting at this bar in Miami Beach and drinking poisonous cocktails out of these ceramic coconut shells. I don't know why they use ceramic coconut shells because the whole place was infested with real coconut trees. These are arcane mysteries I will never penetrate. Anyhow her presence came on very strong and I wrote this song for Janis Joplin at the Chelsea Hotel."
