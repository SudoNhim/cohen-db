            "I used to notice about three in the morning every night there was this young woman there.I've seen her night after night, finally I gathered my courage and I said \"Are you looking for someone?\" She said \"Yes I'm looking for Kris Kristofferson\" I said \"You're in luck,I am Kris Kristofferson !\" And you know : she believed me,It was just a measure of her desperation that she was ready to accept me as Kris Kristofferson.I talked about my helicopter about my horses in Tennessee.A couple of years after she died I was sittin' at this bar in Miami Beach...one of the less glorious episodes of my life...a Polynesian restaurant, waiting for my spare ribs and my thai cocktail... a dismal moment...and I started to write this song on a napkin for Janis Joplin,the \"Chelsea Hotel\"....."
