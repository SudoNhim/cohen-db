And late at night, sometimes in the elevator, I used to bump into a famous singer there, a young woman, who entertained thousands so gracefully and so gloriously. And I would look at her in the elevator, and she would look at me. I knew that she was actually looking for Kris Kristofferson but she would, well maybe she'd settle for me..."
