It was a wonderful place you know, you could come up to the reception desk there with three naked women a bear and a midget and they wouldn't even raise an eyebrow, just hand you your key and say, \"Good night Sir\". And in the elevator....the elevator was the source of my social life there. I used to meet people in the elevator there. I met a distinguished singer, a woman, in the elevator. I used to see her every night there, a very famous singer. I was a famous singer myself. But...I used to see her in that elevator, she was always alone, you know..I said \"Are you looking for someone?\". She said \"Yes\" - I said \"Who ?\" - She said \"Kris Kristofferson\" - I said \"I'm Kris Kristofferson !\" - She said \"No he's a lot taller than you,isn't he?\" - It's true. Anyway,the young woman was Janis Joplin and I wrote this song for her."
