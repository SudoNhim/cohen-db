            "About ten years ago I came to NYC with some songs. I have been living on a Greek island for about 8 years at the time. And it was kind of hard to get anybody to listen to them. You know they've kind of said \"Just stand up Kid and turn around, you're a little old for this aren't you\" .There was one person in NYC that listened to the songs and that was Judy Collins. And she recorded them and I think anything that happened to me subsequently was because of the interest she took in the songs when she first read them. Around that time I was living in the Penn Terminal Hotel on 34th Street, gruesome establishment as the name indicates.And I wrote this song at that time."
